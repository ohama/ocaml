When creating an application, you'll want to put more than one widget inside a window. Our first helloworld example only used one widget so we could simply use a #add (or #pack) method call to "pack" the widget into the window. But when you want to put more than one widget into a window, how do you control where that widget is positioned? This is where packing comes in.
