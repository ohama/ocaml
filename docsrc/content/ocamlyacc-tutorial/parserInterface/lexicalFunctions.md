The lexical analyzer function, named after rule declarations, recognizes tokens from the input stream and returns them to the parser.
Ocamlyacc does not create this function automatically; you must write it so that parser function can call it. The function is sometimes referred to as a lexical scanner.


This function is usually generated by ocamllex. See Chapter 12 Lexer and parser generators (ocamllex, ocamlyacc).
