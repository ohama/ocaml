As described above in the <a href="ch05s05.html" title="GtkCellRendererText, UTF8, and pango markup">"GtkCellRendererText, UTF8, and pango markup" section</a>,
all strings that are to be displayed in the tree view need to be encoded
in UTF8 encoding. All ASCII strings are valid UTF8, but as soon as non-ASCII
characters are used, things get a bit tricky and the character encoding matters.
</p><p>
Comparing two ASCII strings ignoring the case is trivial and can be done
using <tt class="literal">g_ascii_strcasecmp</tt>, for example. <tt class="literal">strcasecmp</tt>
will usually do the same, only that it is also locale-aware to some extent.
The only problem is that a lot of users use locale character encodings that
are not UTF8, so <tt class="literal">strcasecmp</tt> does not take us very far.
</p><p>
<tt class="literal">g_utf8_collate</tt> will compare two strings in UTF8 encoding,
but it does not ignore the case. In order to achieve at least half-way correct
linguistic case-insensitive sorting, we need to take a two-step approach.
For example, we could use <tt class="literal">g_utf8_casefold</tt> to convert the
strings to compare into a form that is independent of case, and then use
<tt class="literal">g_utf8_collate</tt> to compare those two strings (note that the
strings returned by <tt class="literal">g_utf8_casefold</tt> will not resemble the
original string in any recognisable way; they will work fine for comparisons
though). Alternatively, one could use <tt class="literal">g_utf8_strdown</tt>
on both strings and then compare the results again with
<tt class="literal">g_utf8_collate</tt>.
</p><p>
Obviously, all this is not going to be very fast, and adds up if you have a
lot of rows. To speed things up, you can create a 'collation key' with
<tt class="literal">g_utf8_collate_key</tt> and store that in your model as
well. A collation key is just a string that does not mean anything to
us, but can be used with <tt class="literal">strcmp</tt> for string comparison
purposes (which is a lot faster than <tt class="literal">g_utf8_collate</tt>).
</p><p>
It should be noted that the way <tt class="literal">g_utf8_collate</tt> sorts
is dependent on the current locale. Make sure you are not working in the
'C' locale (=default, none specified) before you are wondering about weird
sorting orders. Check with 'echo $LANG' on a command line what you current
locale is set to.
