A cell data function is a function that is called for a specific cell renderer
for each single row before that row is rendered. It gives you maximum control
over what exactly is going to be rendered, as you can set the cell renderer's
properties just like you want to have them. Remember not only to
<span class="emphasis"><em>set</em></span> a property if you want it to be active, but also to
<span class="emphasis"><em>unset</em></span> a property if it should not be active (and it might
have been set in the previous row).
</p><p>
Cell data functions are often used if you want more fine-grained control over
what is to be displayed, or if the standard way to display something is not
quite like you want it to be. A case in point are floating point numbers. If
you want floating point numbers to be displayed in a certain way, say with only
one digit after the colon/comma, then you need to use a cell data function.

to set up a
cell data function for a particular cell renderer. Here is an example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
(* file: data_func.ml *)

open Gobject.Data

let cols = new GTree.column_list
let col_name = cols#add string
let col_age = cols#add float

let create_model data =
  let store = GTree.tree_store cols in
  ...

let age_cell_data_func renderer (model:GTree.model) iter =
  let age = model#get ~row:iter ~column:col_age in
  renderer#set_properties [`TEXT (Printf.sprintf "%.1f" age)]
  
let create_view ~model ~packing () =
  ...
  let renderer_text = GTree.cell_renderer_text [] in
  let col = GTree.view_column ~title:"Age" ~renderer:(renderer_text, []) () in
  col#set_cell_data_func renderer_text (age_cell_data_func renderer_text);
  ...
</pre><p>
for each row to be rendered by this particular cell renderer, the cell data
function is going to be called, which then retrieves the float from the model,
and turns it into a string where the float has only one digit after the
colon/comma, and renders that with the text cell renderer.
</p><p>
This is only a simple example, you can make cell data functions a lot more
complicated if you want to. As always, there is a trade-off to keep in mind
though. Your cell data function is going to be called every single time a
cell in that (renderer) column is going to be rendered. Go and check how
often this function is called in your program if you ever use one. If you
do time-consuming operations within a cell data function, things are not
going to be fast, especially if you have a lot of rows. The alternative
in this case would have been to make an additional column
<span class="emphasis"><em>column_age_float_string</em></span> of type <tt class="literal">string</tt>, and to set
the float in string form whenever you set the float itself in a row, and then
hook up the string column to a text cell renderer using attributes. This way
the float to string conversion would only need to be done once. This is a cpu
cycles / memory trade-off, and it depends on your particular case which one
is more suitable. Things you should probably not do is to convert long strings
into UTF8 format in a cell data function, for example.
</p><p>
You might notice that your cell data function is called at times even for rows
that are not visible at the moment. This is because the tree view needs to know
its total height, and in order to calculate this it needs to know the height of
each and every single row, and it can only know that by having it measured, which
is going to be slow when you have a lot of rows with different heights (if your
rows all have the same height, there should not be any visible delay though).
