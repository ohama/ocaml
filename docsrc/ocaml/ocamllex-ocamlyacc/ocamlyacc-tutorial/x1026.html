>&#13;A reduce/reduce conflict occurs if there are two or more rules that apply
to the same sequence of input.  This usually indicates a serious error
in the grammar.
</P
><P
>&#13;For example, here is an erroneous attempt to define a sequence
of zero or more <TT
CLASS="literal"
>word</TT
> groupings.
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;sequence: /* empty */	{ printf "empty sequence\n" }
        | maybeword	{}
        | sequence word	{ printf "added word %s\n" $2 }
        ;

maybeword: /* empty */	{ printf "empty maybeword\n" }
        | word		{ printf "single word %s\n" $1 }
        ;
</PRE
><P
>&#13;The error is an ambiguity: there is more than one way to parse a single
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>word</TT
> into a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sequence</TT
>.  It could be reduced to a
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>maybeword</TT
> and then into a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sequence</TT
> via the second rule.
Alternatively, nothing-at-all could be reduced into a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sequence</TT
>
via the first rule, and this could be combined with the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>word</TT
>
using the third rule for <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sequence</TT
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;There is also more than one way to reduce nothing-at-all into a
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>sequence</TT
>.  This can be done directly via the first rule,
or indirectly via <TT
CLASS="literal"
>maybeword</TT
> and then the second rule.
</P
><P
>&#13;You might think that this is a distinction without a difference, because it
does not change whether any particular input is valid or not.  But it does
affect which actions are run.  One parsing order runs the second rule's
action; the other runs the first rule's action and the third rule's action.
In this example, the output of the program changes.
</P
><P
>&#13;Ocamlyacc resolves a reduce/reduce conflict by choosing to use the rule that
appears first in the grammar, but it is very risky to rely on this.  Every
reduce/reduce conflict must be studied and usually eliminated.  Here is the
proper way to define <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sequence</TT
>:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;sequence: /* empty */	{ printf "empty sequence\n" }
        | sequence word 	{ printf "added word %s\n" $2 }
        ;
</PRE
><P
>&#13;Here is another common error that yields a reduce/reduce conflict:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;sequence: /* empty */
        | sequence words
        | sequence redirects
        ;

words:    /* empty */
        | words word
        ;

redirects:/* empty */
        | redirects redirect
        ;
</PRE
><P
>&#13;The intention here is to define a sequence which can contain either
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>word</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="literal"
>redirect</TT
> groupings.  The individual definitions of
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>sequence</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>words</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>redirects</TT
> are error-free, but the
three together make a subtle ambiguity: even an empty input can be parsed
in infinitely many ways!
</P
><P
>&#13;Consider: nothing-at-all could be a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>words</TT
>.  Or it could be two
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>words</TT
> in a row, or three, or any number.  It could equally well be a
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>redirects</TT
>, or two, or any number.  Or it could be a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>words</TT
>
followed by three <TT
CLASS="literal"
>redirects</TT
> and another <TT
CLASS="literal"
>words</TT
>.  And so on.
</P
><P
>&#13;Here are two ways to correct these rules.  First, to make it a single level
of sequence:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;sequence: /* empty */
        | sequence word
        | sequence redirect
        ;
</PRE
><P
>&#13;Second, to prevent either a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>words</TT
> or a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>redirects</TT
>
from being empty:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;sequence: /* empty */
        | sequence words
        | sequence redirects
        ;

words:    word
        | words word
        ;

redirects:redirect
        | redirects redirect
        ;
