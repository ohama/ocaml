CLASS="literal"
>1</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>-</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>2</TT

should it reduce them via the rule for the subtraction operator?  It
depends on the next token.  Of course, if the next token is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>)</TT
>, we
must reduce; shifting is invalid because no single rule can reduce the
token sequence <TT
CLASS="literal"
>- 2 )</TT
> or anything starting with that.  But if
the next token is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>*</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="literal"
>**</TT
>, we have a choice: either
shifting or reduction would allow the parse to complete, but with
different results.
</P
><P
>&#13;To decide which one Ocamlyacc should do, we must consider the results.  If
the next operator token <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>op</I
></SPAN
> is shifted, then it must be reduced
first in order to permit another opportunity to reduce the difference.
The result is (in effect) <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1 - (2 op 3)</TT
>.  On the other
hand, if the subtraction is reduced before shifting <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>op</I
></SPAN
>, the result
is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>(1 - 2) op 3</TT
>.  Clearly, then, the choice of shift or
reduce should depend on the relative precedence of the operators
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>-</TT
> and <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>op</I
></SPAN
>: <TT
CLASS="literal"
>*</TT
> should be shifted first, but not
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>**</TT
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;What about input such as <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1 - 2 - 5</TT
>; should this be
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>(1 - 2) - 5</TT
> or should it be <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1 - (2 - 5)</TT
>?  For most
operators we prefer the former, which is called <TT
CLASS="literal"
>left association</TT
>.
The latter alternative, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>right association</TT
>, is desirable for
assignment operators.  The choice of left or right association is a
matter of whether the parser chooses to shift or reduce when the stack
contains <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1 - 2</TT
> and the look-ahead token is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>-</TT
>: shifting
makes right-associativity.

>&#13;Ocamlyacc allows you to specify these choices with the operator precedence
declarations <TT
CLASS="literal"
>%left</TT

CLASS="literal"

contains a list of tokens, which are operators whose precedence and
associativity is being declared.  The <TT
CLASS="literal"
>%left</TT
> declaration makes all
those operators left-associative and the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>%right</TT

them right-associative.  A third alternative is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>%nonassoc</TT
>, which
declares that it is a syntax error to find the same operator twice ``in a
row''.

>&#13;The relative precedence of different operators is controlled by the
order in which they are declared.  The first <TT

<TT

precedence is lowest, the next such declaration declares the operators
whose precedence is a little higher, and so on.

><P
>&#13;The first effect of the precedence declarations is to assign precedence
levels to the terminal symbols declared.  The second effect is to assign
precedence levels to certain rules: each rule gets its precedence from the
last terminal symbol mentioned in the components.  (You can also specify
explicitly the precedence of a rule.
See <A
HREF="x996.html"
>Context-Dependent Precedence</A
>.)
</P
><P
>&#13;Finally, the resolution of conflicts works by comparing the
precedence of the rule being considered with that of the
look-ahead token.  If the token's precedence is higher, the
choice is to shift.  If the rule's precedence is higher, the
choice is to reduce.  If they have equal precedence, the choice
is made based on the associativity of that precedence level.  The
verbose output file made by <TT
CLASS="literal"
>-v</TT
>
(see <A
HREF="c1152.html"
>Invoking Ocamlyacc</A
>)
says
how each conflict was resolved.
</P
><P
>&#13;Not all rules and not all tokens have precedence.  If either the rule or
the look-ahead token has no precedence, then the default is to shift.
