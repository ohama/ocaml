      <description>Introduction Ocamlyacc is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a Ocaml program to parse that grammar. Once you are proficient with Ocamlyacc, you may use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.
Ocamlyacc is very close to the well-known yacc (or bison) commands that can be found in most C programming environments.</description>
