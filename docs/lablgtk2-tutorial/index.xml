      <description>GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL license, so you can develop open software, free software, or even commercial non-free software using GTK without having to spend anything for licenses or royalties.
It&amp;rsquo;s called the GIMP toolkit because it was originally written for developing the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GTK has now been used in a large number of software projects, including the GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project.</description>

      <description>These all require authors! :) Please consider contributing to our tutorial.
If you must use one of these widgets that are undocumented, I strongly suggest you take a look at their respective header files in the GTK distribution. GTK&amp;rsquo;s function names are very descriptive. Once you have an understanding of how things work, it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to figure out how to use a widget simply by looking at its function declarations.</description>
