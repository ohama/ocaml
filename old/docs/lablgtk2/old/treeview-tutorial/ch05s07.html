This seems to be a frequently asked question, so it is worth mentioning it here. You
have the two approaches mentioned above: either you use cell data functions, and check
in each whether a particular row should be highlighted in a particular way (bold, coloured, whatever),
and then set the renderer properties accordingly (and unset them if you want that row to look normal),
or you use attributes. Cell data functions are most likely not the right choice in this case though.
</p><p>
If you only want every second line to have a gray background to make it easier
for the user to see which data belongs to which line in wide tree views, then
you do not have to bother with the stuff mentioned here. Instead just set the
rules hint on the tree view as described in the <a href="ch04s02.html" title="Tree View Look and Feel">
here</a>, and everything will be done automatically, in colours that conform
to the chosen theme even (unless the theme disables rule hints, that is).
</p><p>
Otherwise, the most suitable approach for most cases is that you add two columns
to your model, one for the property itself (e.g. a column <span class="emphasis"><em>col_row_color</em></span>
of type <tt class="literal">string</tt>), and one for the boolean flag
of the property (e.g. a column <span class="emphasis"><em>col_row_color_set</em></span> of type
<tt class="literal">boolean</tt>). You would then connect these columns
with the <tt class="literal">"foreground"</tt> and <tt class="literal">"foreground-set"</tt>
properties of each renderer. Now, whenever you set a row's <span class="emphasis"><em>col_row_color</em></span>
field to a colour, and set that row's <span class="emphasis"><em>col_row_color_set</em></span> field to <tt class="literal">true</tt>,
then this column will be rendered in the colour of your choice. If you
only want either the default text colour or one special other colour,
you could even achieve the same thing with just one extra model column:
in this case you could just set all renderer's <tt class="literal">"foreground"</tt>
property to whatever special color you want, and only connect the <span class="emphasis"><em>col_row_color_set</em></span>
column to all renderer's <tt class="literal">"foreground-set"</tt> property using
attributes. This works similar with any other attribute, only that you need to adjust
the data type for the property of course (e.g. <tt class="literal">"weight"</tt> would take a
<tt class="literal">int</tt>, in form of a <tt class="literal">PANGO_WEIGHT_FOO</tt>
define in this case).
</p><p>
As a general rule, you should not change the text colour or the background
colour of a cell unless you have a really good reason for it.

Pennington: &#8220;<span class="quote">Because colors in GTK+ represent a theme the user has chosen, you should never
set colors purely for aesthetic reasons. If users don't like GTK+ gray, they can change it themselves
to their favorite shade of orange.</span>&#8221;
