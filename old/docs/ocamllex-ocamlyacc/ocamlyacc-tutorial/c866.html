>Chapter 6. The Ocamlyacc Parser Algorithm</H1
><P
>&#13;As Ocamlyacc reads tokens, it pushes them onto a stack along with their
semantic values.  The stack is called the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>parser stack</TT
>.  Pushing a
token is traditionally called <TT
CLASS="literal"
>shifting</TT
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;For example, suppose the infix calculator has read <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1 + 5 *</TT
>, with a
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>3</TT
> to come.  The stack will have four elements, one for each token
that was shifted.
</P
><P
>&#13;But the stack does not always have an element for each token read.  When
the last <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>n</I
></SPAN
> tokens and groupings shifted match the components of a
grammar rule, they can be combined according to that rule.  This is called
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>reduction</TT
>.  Those tokens and groupings are replaced on the stack by a
single grouping whose symbol is the result (left hand side) of that rule.
Running the rule's action is part of the process of reduction, because this
is what computes the semantic value of the resulting grouping.
</P
><P
>&#13;For example, if the infix calculator's parser stack contains this:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;1 + 5 * 3
</PRE
><P
>&#13;and the next input token is a newline character, then the last three
elements can be reduced to 15 via the rule:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;expr: expr MULTIPLY expr;
</PRE
><P
>&#13;Then the stack contains just these three elements:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;1 + 15
</PRE
><P
>&#13;At this point, another reduction can be made, resulting in the single value
16.  Then the newline token can be shifted.
</P
><P
>&#13;The parser tries, by shifts and reductions, to reduce the entire input down
to a single grouping whose symbol is the grammar's start-symbol
(see <A
HREF="c42.html#sec-language-and-grammar"
>Languages and Context-Free Grammars</A
>).
</P
><P
>&#13;This kind of parser is known in the literature as a bottom-up parser.

><P
>&#13;The Ocamlyacc parser does <SPAN

> always reduce immediately as soon as the
last <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>n</I
></SPAN
> tokens and groupings match a rule.  This is because such a
simple strategy is inadequate to handle most languages.  Instead, when a
reduction is possible, the parser sometimes ``looks ahead'' at the next
token in order to decide what to do.
</P
><P
>&#13;When a token is read, it is not immediately shifted; first it becomes the
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>look-ahead token</TT
>, which is not on the stack.  Now the parser can
perform one or more reductions of tokens and groupings on the stack, while
the look-ahead token remains off to the side.  When no more reductions
should take place, the look-ahead token is shifted onto the stack.  This
does not mean that all possible reductions have been done; depending on the
token type of the look-ahead token, some rules may choose to delay their
application.
</P
><P
>&#13;Here is a simple case where look-ahead is needed.  These three rules define
expressions which contain binary addition operators and postfix unary
factorial operators (<TT
CLASS="literal"
>FACTORIAL</TT
> for '!'),
and allow parentheses for grouping.
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;expr:     term PLUS expr
        | term
        ;

term:     LPAREN expr RPAREN
        | term FACTORIAL 
        | NUMBER
        ;
</PRE
><P
>&#13;Suppose that the tokens <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1 + 2</TT
> have been read and shifted;
what should be done?  If the following token is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>RPAREN</TT
>,
then the first three tokens must be reduced to form an <TT
CLASS="literal"
>expr</TT
>.
This is the only valid
course, because shifting
the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>RPAREN</TT
> would produce a sequence of symbols
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>term RPAREN</TT
>, and no rule allows this.
</P
><P
>&#13;If the following token is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>FACTORIAL</TT
>, that is '!',
then it must be shifted immediately so
that <TT
CLASS="literal"
>2 !</TT
> can be reduced to make a
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>term</TT
>.
If instead the
parser were to reduce before shifting,
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>1 + 2</TT
> would become an
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>expr</TT
>.
It would then be impossible to shift the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>!</TT
> because
doing so would produce on the stack the sequence of symbols
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>expr FACTORIAL</TT
>.
No rule allows that sequence.
